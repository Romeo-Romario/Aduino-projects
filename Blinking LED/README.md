# ðŸ”Œ Arduino LED Blinking Experiment  

ðŸŽ¯ **My First Experiment with Arduino Components & Basic Functions!**  

This small project was my **first step** into the world of **Arduino**. The goal? **To control three independent LEDs**,<br> making them **blink sequentially**â€”but with a twist!  

---

## âœ¨ Project Idea  
âœ… Three LEDs (**Yellow, Green, and Red**) blink **one after another**.  
âœ… If one **turns off**, the remaining LEDs start blinking **twice as fast**! âš¡
